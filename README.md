## Overview

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project: Etch-A-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). This project had us create a browser version of something between a sketch pad and an [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This involved the use of DOM Manipulation to change the User Interface when the user interacts with the grid and the webpage.

## Learning Points
- Understood more DOM Manipulation and Event Listeners (Event delegation, input and mouseover events)
- Understood more Javascript concepts (Arrays and loops)

## Roadmap
- [x] Writing a webpage with a 16x16 grid
- [x] Set up a hover effect so that the grid div changes from white to black when your mouse passes over them
- [x] Adding a slider to change the grid size and a button to clear the current grid
- [x] Adding options for the user to change the grid div colours to a random RGB colour or adding a progressive darkening effect
